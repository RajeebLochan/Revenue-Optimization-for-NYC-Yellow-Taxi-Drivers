# NYC Yellow Taxi Revenue Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between **payment methods** and **fare amounts** using the NYC Yellow Taxi Trip dataset. The objective is to uncover patterns that can help taxi drivers **optimize revenue** by understanding how **Credit Card** and **Cash** payments impact earnings.

## Objective

To determine whether the mode of payment significantly affects the fare amount, and how this insight can be used to guide taxi drivers and fleet operators toward revenue-maximizing strategies.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [NYC TLC on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data)
- **Scope**: Yellow Taxi trips from Jan 2015 and Jan–Mar 2016
- **Fields Used**: pickup/dropoff datetime, fare amount, trip distance, payment type, passenger count

## Key Insights

- **Credit Card payments** are associated with higher fare amounts due to the inclusion of tips and longer ride distances.
- **Cash payments** are generally for shorter trips and do not record tips, potentially underreporting true earnings.
- Strategies like targeting card-preferred zones and time slots can improve driver revenue.
